# Tracking COVID-19 in Louisiana

This script accesses the ArcGIS Rest endpoints of the dashboard used by the Louisiana Department of Health to track the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic and add the latest data to csv files to preserve this data for time-series analysis.

As of this update, LDH provides the following data:<br>
* Cases (Parish-level) in cases.csv
* Deaths (Parish-level) reported to the state in deaths.csv
* Tests conducted by public and private labs (Statewide) in tests.csv (Note: testing information prior to 3/9/2020 is based on public statements from state officials.)
* Public and private tests by parish in test_details.csv (Parish-level)
* Age groups, median age, age range and sex of those who tested positve (Statewide) in case_demo.csv
* Age groups of those who died (Statewide) in death_demo.csv
* Number of hospital beds, ICUs and ventilators available, in use and total in each LDH Region (http://ldh.la.gov/index.cfm/page/2) in capacity.csv. (Note: Prior to LDH adding these statistics to their dashboard on 4/2/2020, capacity figures were reported somewhat sporatically. Data for previous days has been reconstructed as well as possible but may be missing data or include data that is not consistent with how LDH is currently counting resources.)
* Number of patients confirmed positive for COVID-19 hospitalized and on ventilators (Statewide) in hospitalizations.csv. (Note: This file will also include PUI - Patient Under Investigation - information on days it is made available).
* Data on the date patients who tested positive reported their first symptoms started and the date deaths actually occurred, as opposed to the date they were reported to the state (Statewide) in symptoms_date_of_death.csv. (Note: the state adds an additional days' worth of data each day but also may adjust previous days' data.).

Null fields in any file represent days in which that information was not made available.

LDH is currently updating their dashboard once a day at noon. This script should be run after the update to capture the data for each day. If it is run multiple times per day, it will overwrite any previous data for the day with the updated data.

My goal is to update the CSV files in this repository every day, as soon after the noon update as possible. This will often be within minutes but may take longer if LDH updates their schema, any problems are detected in the data or other work takes priority.

If you have questions about this data or find it useful, please email Jeff Adelson at jadelson@theadvocate.com.
